1. Show that *a + b* can be less than *min(a,b).

> True if *a and b* are both * < 0*

2. Show that *a * b* can be less than *min(a,b).

> True if *a and b* lie on opposite sides of 0 on the number line; i.e. * a > 0 and b < 0* or vice versa.

3. Design/draw a road network with two points *a* and *b* such that the fastest route between *a* and *b* is not the shortest route.

> Two points at the end of a horse-shoe shaped curve separated by water. Shortest route requires crossing the water while land route
nearly circumnavigates the curve.

4. Design/draw a road network with two points *a* and *b* such that the shortest route between *a* and *b* is not the route with the fewest turns.

> A route with a staircase-function like route might be the shortest if it is the most direct access route. Other routes with fewer turns
might require travelling redundant distances.
