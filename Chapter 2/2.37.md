When you first learned to multiply numbers, you were told that *x×y* means adding *x* a total of *y* times, so *5×4=5+5+5+5=20*. What is the time complexity of multiplying two *n*-digit numbers in base *b* (people work in base 10, of course, while computers work in base 2) using the repeated addition method, as a function of *n* and *b*. Assume that single-digit by single-digit addition or multiplication takes *O(1)* time. (Hint: how big can *y* be as a function of *n* and *b*?)

**Solution**

Assumption: Adding two single-digit numbers takes *O(1)* time. Adding two *n*-digit numbers thus will take ~ *2n* operations.

The multiplier (e.g. 4 in the question example) can have a value of up to *b^n*. For example, *n = 2* digits for the number 24, thus the additions have to be repeated in the worst case *99* times.

Thus the time complexity of the whole scenario is ~ *2n * b ^n* -> *O(n * b^n)*.
