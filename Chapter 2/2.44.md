**Question**

We have 1,000 data items to store on 1,000 nodes. Each node can store copies of exactly three different items. Propose a replication scheme to minimize data loss as nodes fail. What is the expected number of data entries that get lost when three random nodes fail?

**Solution**

Algorithm
  * While count of chosen nodes < 3
  * choose a node at random in the range 1 - 1000
  * if chosed node has been chosen before, continue
  * if chosen node has all three data slots filled, continue
  * Otherwise, store data in one of its slots and increment count of chosen nodes


The probability that you lose all data is ( 1 / 1000 ) * (1 / 999) * (1 / 998). This is the probability of chosing three random nodes that all store some single data point.

There is also the possibility of having 3 random nodes store exactly the same data. Giving the various permutations that can end up in this scenario gives 6. Thus if those three nodes go down, the number of lost data entries will be 3. This is quite high.

A better approach is given [here](http://blog.panictank.net/the-algorithm-design-manual-chapter-2/).
