You have a 100-story building and a couple of marbles. You must identify the lowest floor for which a marble will break if you drop it from this floor. How fast can you find this floor if you are given an infinite supply of marbles? What if you have only two marbles?

**Solution**

  * Infinite marbles -> Use binary search and should take about 7 marbles
  * Only 2 marbles -> 
      * Start from 50th floor (mid point).
      * If marble breaks, walk from 1 - 50 to find first floor. 
      * Otherwise, go to 75th floor
      * If marble breaks, walk from 50 - 75th floor and so on.
