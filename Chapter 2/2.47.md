You are given 10 bags of gold coins. Nine bags contain coins that each weigh 10 grams. One bag contains all false coins 
that weigh one gram less. You must identify this bag in just one weighing. You have a digital balance that reports the 
weight of what is placed on it.

**Solution**
  - Get a new empty bag
  - Number the 10 bags from one through ten
  - Take the corresponding number of balls from each bag. E.g. One ball from bag 1, Two from bag 2 and so on
  - Put all these balls into the new bag
  - Weigh the bag
  - The expected weight (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10) * single coin weight - actual weight should give a differential value
  - Use the differential value to identify the bag with the lighter coins since the actual coin weight is 10 grams and the fake coins weigh 9 grams.
