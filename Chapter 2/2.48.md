You have eight balls all of the same size. Seven of them weigh the same, and one of them weighs slightly more. How can you find the ball that is heavier by using a balance and only two weighings?

**Solution**

Split the balls into two groups of three and one group of two.

Weigh the two groups of three - if they are equal then weigh the two remaining balls to find the heavier ball.

Otherwise, select the set of three balls that are heavier. Split into three and weigh two of the balls.

If they are equal, then the last ball is the heaviest otherwise the weigh would show the heavier ball.
