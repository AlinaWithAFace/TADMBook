Design a dictionary data structure in which search, insertion, and deletion can all be processed in O(1) time in the worst case. You may assume the set elements are integers drawn from a finite set 1, 2, .., n, and initialization can take O(n) time.

**Solution**

This is a set of unique numbers, since initialization can take up to O(n); just create an array with numbers in the range. 

To look up, delete or insert will be constant O(1) then. Deletion is simply setting a value to null/empty. Insertion is setting the flag to on/true. Lookup will determine whether the value at that point exists or not.
