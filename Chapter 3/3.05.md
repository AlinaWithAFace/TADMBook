 Find the overhead fraction (the ratio of data space over total space) for each of the following binary tree implementations on n nodes:

 * All nodes store data, two child pointers, and a parent pointer. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires four bytes.
 * Only leaf nodes store data; internal nodes store two child pointers. The data field requires four bytes and each pointer requires two bytes.

**Solution**

 * All nodes -> 4 / (4 + 3*4) -> 1/4
 
 
 * In a tree with n leaf nodes, there are n-1 ancestor nodes. Since only leaf nodes store data, this
   becomes
   
   4*n / (4*n + 2*2(n-1)) -> 4n / (4n + 4n - 4) -> n / 2n - 1 ~ 1/2 at large n.
   
   This approach is much more efficient as half of total storage space is used for information storage
