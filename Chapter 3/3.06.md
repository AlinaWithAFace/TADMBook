Describe how to modify any balanced tree data structure such that search, insert, delete, minimum, and maximum still take O(logn) time each, but successor and predecessor now take O(1) time each. Which operations have to be modified to support this?

**Solution**

This can work by using a mix of the typical tree and a double-linked list for predecessor/successor
look up.

Given a particular node n, we can retrieve its successor/predecessor in O(1) via the linked list.

Search, minimum and maximum would still traverse the tree and result in O(logN) time (+ a negligible constant time for retrieving the value from the linkedlist).

Insert and deletion would also be O(logN). Insert a new value into a tree would take logN to determine the new position. The parent of the node is now the predecessor in the linkedList; the last step is to
add the new node as a child and add the successor of the parent as the successor of the child. Ditto for the delete scenario.
