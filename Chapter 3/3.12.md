3-12. Suppose you are given an input set *S* of *n* numbers, and a black box that if given any sequence of real numbers and an integer *k* instantly and correctly answers whether there is a subset of input sequence whose sum is exactly *k*. Show how to use the black box *O(n)* times to find a subset of *S* that adds up to *k*. 

**Solution** 

 * This looks like a bin packing problem; however we can instantly verify whether a subset contains a sequence adding up to some value.
 
 * Steps
    
    *  Enter the whole set into the blackbox; if it gives a no response, then return as the sequence contains no subsequence adding up to *k*.
    *  Otherwise, remove the first element of the set and re-run the remaining set through the blackbox
    
       * If it gives a yes; delete the element from the set
    * Process the remaining elements in the same pattern until the subset adding up to continue processing elements in the same patternkcontinue processing elements in the same pattern is found.
