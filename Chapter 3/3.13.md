3-13. Let *A[1..n]* be an array of real numbers. Design an algorithm to perform any sequence of the following operations:

 * *Add(i,y)* -- Add the value *y* to the *ith* number.
 * *Partial-sum(i)* -- Return the sum of the first *i* numbers, i.e. *∑<sub>j=1</sub><sup>i</sup>A[j]*. There are no insertions or deletions; the only change is to the values of the numbers. Each operation should take *O(logn)* steps. You may use one additional array of size *n* as a work space.

**Solution** 

This requires a binary tree that is balanced.

Start out with a binary tree such that all its leaves are elements of the array in the same order. Now for each non-leave node in the tree, give it a value that is the sum of its child node values. For example, a tree with only 2 leaf nodes of value 1 and 2 will have a root value of 3.

Since there are *n-1* non-leaf nodes in a tree with *n* nodes; this takes *O(n)* time to build the tree.

 ***Add(i,y)* -- Add the value *y* to the *ith* number. **

   Walk to the *ith* node in the tree; then walk up from that node to the root of the tree making sure to add the value *y* to every node you encounter.
   
 **Partial-sum(i)* -- Return the sum of the first *i* numbers, i.e. *∑<sub>j=1</sub><sup>i</sup>A[j]* **
   
   Find the path to the *ith* node and walk to it from the root of the tree. Every time you take a right turn in the tree, add the value of the left child of that node to the accumulated sum. When you get to the leaf node itself, add its value to the accumulated sum (and also remember to add its left counterpart too if it is a right child).
   
   
Both operations take *O(logn)* steps since that is the height of the tree.
