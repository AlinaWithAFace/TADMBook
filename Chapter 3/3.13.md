3-13. Let *A[1..n]* be an array of real numbers. Design an algorithm to perform any sequence of the following operations:

 * *Add(i,y)* -- Add the value *y* to the ith number.
 * *Partial-sum(i)* -- Return the sum of the first *i* numbers, i.e. *âˆ‘<sub>j=1</sub><sup>i</sup>A[j]*. There are no insertions or deletions; the only change is to the values of the numbers. Each operation should take *O(logn)* steps. You may use one additional array of size *n* as a work space.
