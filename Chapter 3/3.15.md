3.15. Design a data structure that allows one to search, insert, and delete an integer *X* in *O(1)* time (i.e., constant time, independent of the total number of integers stored). Assume that *1≤X≤n* and that there are *m+n* units of space available, where *m* is the maximum number of integers that can be in the table at any one time. (Hint: use two arrays *A[1..n]* and *B[1..m]*.)
You are not allowed to initialize either *A* or *B*, as that would take *O(m)* or *O(n)* operations. This means the arrays are full of random garbage to begin with, so you must be very careful.

**Solution**

So my first pass at this would have used the *A* array to store *X* values i.e. *A[X] = X* for inserts and then using the *B* array to track repeated counts. However this runs into issues; since we cannot initialize either *A* or *B*; how do we verify that a lookup of any location in *A* is an invalid value?

I found a better solution [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/9575942/721491) and I am explaining it in my words below:

Create two arrays *A* whose entries point to the index of storage objects in *B* and *B* to hold the numbers and their occurence counts. There is also a need for a counter variable that tracks the number of counts stored in *B*.

For example, the arrays look like the following after storing the sequence: 2,3,3,2,3,2,1.

**Note**: Arrays start at 1 and the lengths of *A* and *B* are *N* and *M* respectively. The *X* denotes an uninitialized location which can be garbage.

Index:  1        2         3        4   5   6   7   ...

A :    [1        2         3        X   X   X   X   ...] -> points to count object index in *B*

B :    [(1,x1),  (2,x3)    (3,x3)   X   X   X   X   ...] -> holds the number and its occurence count
