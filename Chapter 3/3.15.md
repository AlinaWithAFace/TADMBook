3.15. Design a data structure that allows one to search, insert, and delete an integer *X* in *O(1)* time (i.e., constant time, independent of the total number of integers stored). Assume that *1≤X≤n* and that there are *m+n* units of space available, where *m* is the maximum number of integers that can be in the table at any one time. (Hint: use two arrays *A[1..n]* and *B[1..m]*.)
You are not allowed to initialize either *A* or *B*, as that would take *O(m)* or *O(n)* operations. This means the arrays are full of random garbage to begin with, so you must be very careful.

**Solution**

So my first pass at this would have used the *A* array to store *X* values i.e. *A[X] = X* for inserts and then using the *B* array to track repeated counts. However this runs into issues; since we cannot initialize either *A* or *B*; how do we verify that a lookup of any location in *A* is an invalid value?
