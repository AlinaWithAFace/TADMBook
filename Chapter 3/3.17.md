3-17. A Caesar shift (see cryptography) is a very simple class of ciphers for secret messages. Unfortunately, they can be broken using statistical properties of English. Develop a program capable of decrypting Caesar shifts of sufficiently long texts.

**Solution**

The Caesar shift moves a number by a specified amount of shifts and is one of the earliest cryptography [schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

A brute force way to break it would be to count the occurrence of each letter in the cipher text and then compare that to the character frequency occurrence order in [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency). This would tend to match for sufficiently long enough text but might not be totally accurate.

Another approach exploits the fact that the key range is small (only 26) and uses that to generate all possible shifts. Then a human can read out the text out of all possible output.

A more accurate approach involves using [frequency distributions](http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/english-letter-frequencies/). See sample implementation [here](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/CaeserDecryptor).
