3-18. What method would you use to look up a word in a dictionary?

**Solution**

Binary search would work if the dictionary is already sorted. However there are other constraints too and a pure binary search might not be so efficient. For example, if searching for *zero*; it might be much faster to start at *z* instead of *m* and continuously halving until *z* is reached.

Other likely candidates are *tries* and *bloom filters*. Read more in this [stack overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1332104/find-the-existence-of-a-word-in-a-large-dictionary).
