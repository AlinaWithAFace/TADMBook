3-19. Imagine you have a closet full of shirts. What can you do to organize your shirts for easy retrieval?

**Solution**

The shirts would likely be in the same size range (with a few deviations) so using size as a measure is not so good.

However they are not likely to be the same colour (unless you are Mark Zuckerberg and then you don't have a sort problem ;) ).

Arrange the shirts by colours and then do a sub-class sorting by colour shades, material type (e.g. cotton, polyester etc), style/type (t-shirt, polos etc) or even sleeve length (full, half etc) in each group.

Retrieval can be done using shirt colours since they are ordered.
