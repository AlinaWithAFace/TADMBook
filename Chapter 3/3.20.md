3-20. Write a function to find the middle node of a singly-linked list.

**Solution**

Create two pointers; a fast and a slow. Have the fast pointer move 2 nodes forward everytime the slow pointer moves once.

When the fast pointer gets to the end of the list; the slow pointer will be at the middle.
