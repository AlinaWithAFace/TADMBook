3-22. Write a program to convert a binary search tree into a linked list.

**Solution**
You could do an in-order traversal of the tree and then push the values onto a linkedlist. This is *O(n)*. This might require some extra work for creating doubly-linked lists.

Another approach would be the rotate algorithm [here](http://inder-gnu.blogspot.com/2007/04/tree-to-linked-list.html) that preserves memory.
