3-27. Determine whether a linked list contains a loop as quickly as possible without using any extra storage. Also, identify the location of the loop.

**Solution**

Use the fast and slow pointer approach. Once the fast pointer encounters the slow pointer, you have proved that there is a loop in the linkedList. This is the Floyd Cycle-finding algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Tortoise_and_hare).
