3-28. You have an unordered array *X* of *n* integers. Find the array *M* containing *n* elements where *M<sub>i</sub>* is the product of all integers in *X* except for *X<sub>i</sub>*. You may not use division. You can use extra memory. (Hint: *There are solutions faster than O(n<sup>2</sup>).*)

**Solution**

1. Simple approach: Multiply each entry; skip the ith entry; quick exit if any encountered value is zero. *O(n)*

2. Another approach would be to split the array around the *ith* element into left and right pairs. Then find the cumulative product of the left half and the cumulative produce of the right half. Both right and left products are then multiplied to give the answer. Still *O(n)*

3. See another *O(nlogn)* approach [here](http://blog.panictank.net/tag/array/).
