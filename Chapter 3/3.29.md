3-29. Give an algorithm for finding an ordered word pair (e.g., *New York*) occurring with the greatest frequency in a given webpage. Which data structures would you use? Optimize both time and space.

**Solution**

1. Simple approach

Use a dictionary. Scan each word and create a pair by joining it to the succeeding word. If that pair already exists in the dictionary, increase its count, else set it to 1. Once done, retrieve the key with the highest frequency in the dictionary.
This would take *O(n)* for time and *O(n)* space. 

The flaw of this approach is the possibility of collisions for huge web page sizes.

2. Trie?
