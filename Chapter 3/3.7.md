Suppose you have access to a balanced dictionary data structure, which supports each of the operations search, insert, delete, minimum, maximum, successor, and predecessor in O(logn) time. Explain how to modify the insert and delete operations so they still take O(logn) but now minimum and maximum take O(1) time. (Hint: think in terms of using the abstract dictionary operations, instead of mucking about with pointers and the like.)

**Solution**

There are several approaches to this.

 * Store the min/max values in some location. 
     * Insertion - compare the value with min/max and update     accordingly. 
     * Deletions - if the item to be deleted is the minimum, get its successor (also O(logN) so doesn't affect the run time of the delete op); update the minimum value to this successor and then delete the element. Do the reverse operation for deletion of the maximum number.

 * Use the data structure of [3.6](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%203/3.6.md). Minimum would always be the head of the linkedlist while Maximum would be the tail.

 * Use min/max heaps?
