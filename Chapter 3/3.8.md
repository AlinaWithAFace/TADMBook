Design a data structure to support the following operations:

  * *insert(x,T)* – Insert item x into the set T .
  * *delete(k,T)* – Delete the kth smallest element from T.
  * *member(x,T)* – Return true iff x ∈ T .
  
All operations must take *O(log n)* time on an *n*-element set.

**Solution**

A classic binary search tree (BST) would not work here because in the worst-case scenario, BSTs
have a time complexity of *O(h)* where *h* is the height of the tree. Think of a tree of positively
increasing numbers.

Balanced trees however can guarantee*O(log n)* times for insertion, deletion and search. Examples include:
