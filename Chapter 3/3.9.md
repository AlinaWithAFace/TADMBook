A *concatenate* takes two sets *S1* and *S2*, where every key in *S1* is smaller than any key in *S2*, and merges them together. Give an algorithm to concatenate two binary search trees into one binary search tree. The worst-case running time should be *O(h)*, where *h* is the maximal height of the two trees.

**Solution**

These are the known conditions about this problem:

 * *S1* and *S2* are sets which implies there are no repeated numbers
 * Every key in *S1* is smaller than any key in *S2*; thus there is no overlap between both sets

One solution will be to traverse the larger tr
