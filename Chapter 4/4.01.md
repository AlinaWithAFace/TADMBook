4.1 The Grinch is given the job of partitioning *2n* players into two teams of *n* players each. Each player has a numerical rating that measures how good he/she is at the game. He seeks to divide the players as unfairly as possible, so as to create the biggest possible talent imbalance between team ***A*** and team ***B***. Show how the Grinch can do the job in *O(nlogn)* time.

**Solution**

Sort all the players by their ratings. Then split the sorted array into two halves, the lower skilled players would be in the bottom half while the better players would be in the top half.
