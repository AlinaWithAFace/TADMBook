4.2. For each of the following problems, give an algorithm that finds the desired numbers within the given amount of time. To keep your answers brief, feel free to use algorithms from the book as subroutines. For the example, *S={6,13,19,3,8}*, 19−3 maximizes the difference, while 8−6 minimizes the difference.

(a) Let *S* be an unsorted array of *n* integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair *x,y∈S* that maximizes *|x−y|*. Your algorithm must run in *O(n)* worst-case time. 

(b) Let *S* be a sorted array of *n* integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair *x,y∈S* that maximizes *|x−y|*. Your algorithm must run in *O(1)* worst-case time. 

(c) Let *S* be an unsorted array of *n* integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair *x,y∈S* that minimizes *|x−y|*, for *x≠y*. Your algorithm must run in *O(nlogn)* worst-case time. 

(d) Let *S* be a sorted array of *n* integers. Give an algorithm that finds the pair *x,y∈S* that minimizes *|x−y|*, for *x≠y*. Your algorithm must run in *O(n)* worst-case time.

**Solution**

(a) Go through the array once, calculating the *max* and *min* element so far. Find the difference. Runs in *O(n)* time.

(b) Find the difference of *S[0]* and *S[n-1]*. Runs in *O(1)* time.

(c) Sort the array in *O(nlogn)*; then go through the array finding the two pairs that are closest in *O(n)*. Runs in *O(nlogn)* time

(d) Same as (c) without the need to sort in *O(nlogn)* to give *O(n)*.
