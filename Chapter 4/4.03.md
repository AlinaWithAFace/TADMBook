4-3. Take a sequence of *2n* real numbers as input. Design an *O(nlogn)* algorithm that partitions the numbers into *n* pairs, with the property that the partition minimizes the maximum sum of a pair. For example, say we are given the numbers *(1,3,5,9)*. The possible partitions are *((1,3),(5,9))*, *((1,5),(3,9))*, and *((1,9),(3,5))*. The pair sums for these partitions are *(4,14)*, *(6,12)*, and *(10,8)*. Thus the third partition has *10* as its maximum sum, which is the minimum over the three partitions.

**Solution**

The way to do this is to create pairs such as *(min<sub>1</sub>, max<sub>2n</sub>)*, *(min<sub>2</sub>, max<sub>2n-1</sub>)*. This would ensure that the pairing would minimize the maximum possible.

To solve this, sort the *2n* sequence, then start from both ends and create pairs until you get to the middle.
