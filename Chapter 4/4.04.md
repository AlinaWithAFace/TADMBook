4-4. Assume that we are given *n* pairs of items as input, where the first item is a number and the second item is one of three colors (red, blue, or yellow). Further assume that the items are sorted by number. Give an *O(n)* algorithm to sort the items by color (all reds before all blues before all yellows) such that the numbers for identical colors stay sorted. For example: (1,blue), (3,red), (4,blue), (6,yellow), (9,red) should become (3,red), (9,red), (1,blue), (4,blue), (6,yellow).

**Solution**

This is a good use case for the bucket sort. Since the array is already sorted, the next steps are:

 * Create the red, blue and yellow buckets. Each bucket holds an array. Takes constant time *O(k)*
 * Walk the array and append each entry to the corresponding colour array. Takes *O(n)*
 * Go through each bucket (in the red, blue, yellow order) and append its entries to the collection array

Total run time is *O(n)*.
