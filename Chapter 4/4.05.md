4-5. The mode of a set of numbers is the number that occurs most frequently in the set. The set *(4,6,2,4,3,1)* has a mode of *4*. Give an efficient and correct algorithm to compute the mode of a set of *n* numbers.

**Solution**

* *O(nlogn)*: Sort the array and then find longest contiguous number sequence length
* *O(n)*: Use a dictionary with each entry as a key and its occurrence account as value.
