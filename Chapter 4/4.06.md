4-6. Given two sets *S1* and *S2* (each of size *n*), and a number *x*, describe an *O(nlogn)* algorithm for finding whether there exists a pair of elements, one from *S1* and one from *S2*, that add up to *x*. (For partial credit, give a *Î˜(n<sup>2</sup>)* algorithm for this problem.)

**Solution**

 * Sort one of the sets, say *S1*. This is *O(nlogn)*
 * Walk each element of *S2*, find the difference between *S<sub>i</sub>* and *x*. This would take *O(n)*
 * Do a binary search of *S1* to see if that value exists in *S1*. This is *O(logn)* each.

Total run time : *O(nlogn)* + *O(nlogn) X O(n)* -> *O(nlogn) + O(nlogn) -> O(nlogn)*.
