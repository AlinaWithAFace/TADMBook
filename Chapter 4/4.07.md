4-7. Outline a reasonable method of solving each of the following problems. Give the order of the worst-case complexity of your methods.

 * You are given a pile of thousands of telephone bills and thousands of checks sent in to pay the bills. Find out who did not pay.
 * You are given a list containing the title, author, call number and publisher of all the books in a school library and another list of 30 publishers. Find out how many of the books in the library were published by each company.
 * You are given all the book checkout cards used in the campus library during the past year, each of which contains the name of the person who took out the book. Determine how many distinct people checked out at least one book.

**Solution**
 * Sort the telephone bills by names, then sort the checks by the names too. Walk through the sorted checks and assign to bills; if a check name does not tally with the bill name, then the corresponding bill entry is that of a defaulter. Continue walking the bills list until you find a match. Worst case complexity is *O(n + m)log n + O(n) * where *n* is the count of bills and *m* is the count of checks.
 
 * Use a bucket sort with a single bucket per publisher. Find the length of the entries in a publisher's bucket. *O(n)* to build, and another *O(m)* to retrieve the count of a publisher's books.
 
 * Sort all the book checkout entries by names and eliminate duplicates.
