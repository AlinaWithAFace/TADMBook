4-8. Given a set of *S* containing *n* real numbers, and a real number *x*. We seek an algorithm to determine whether two elements of *S* exist whose sum is exactly *x*.

 * Assume that *S* is unsorted. Give an *O(nlogn)* algorithm for the problem.
 * Assume that *S* is sorted. Give an *O(n)* algorithm for the problem.

**Solution**

 * See the solution of [4.06](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.06.md).
 * Steps
     *  Create a new array *T* which contains the difference between *x* and every element of *S*
     *  Walk the arrays simultaneously (remember both are sorted) to see if there is an element of *T* in *S*. See algorithm below:
        
        i, j = 1
        while (i <= n && j <= n){
            if(S[i] == T[j]){
                return true;
            } else {
                S[i] < T[j] ? i++ : j++
            }
        }
        
    * Overall run time is about *O(n)* for step a, and *O(2n) -> O(n)* for step b. This gives overall run time of *O(n)*.
