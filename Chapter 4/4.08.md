4-8. Given a set of *S* containing *n* real numbers, and a real number *x*. We seek an algorithm to determine whether two elements of *S* exist whose sum is exactly *x*.

 * Assume that *S* is unsorted. Give an *O(nlogn)* algorithm for the problem.
 * Assume that *S* is sorted. Give an *O(n)* algorithm for the problem.
