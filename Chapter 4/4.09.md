4-9. Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets *A* and *B*, where *n=max(|A|,|B|)*. The output should be an array of distinct elements that form the union of the sets, such that they appear more than once in the union.

* Assume that *A* and *B* are unsorted. Give an *O(nlogn)* algorithm for the problem.
* Assume that *A* and *B* are sorted. Give an *O(n)* algorithm for the problem.

**Solution**

This is quite similar to [4.08](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.08.md).

* Sort *A* and *B* in *O(nlogn)*; then use the *O(n)* merge algorithm described below to create the union. Total run time is *O(nlogn)*

* Use the *O(n)* merge algorithm described below to create the union. Total run time is *O(n)*.


**Merge algorithm**

        i, j, k = 1; U = []
        
        while (i <= |A| && j <= |B|){
        
            if(A[i] == B[j]){
            
                U[k] = A[i]

                i++

                j++

                k++                
                
            } else if (A[i] < B[j]) {
 
                 U[k] = A[i]            
            
                 i++
                 
                 k++
                
            } else {
 
                 U[k] = B[j]            
            
                 j++
                 
                 k++
                
            }
        }
        
        //If any of *A* or *B* is non-empty after the loop runs; add all the remaining elements to *U*
