4-9. Give an efficient algorithm to compute the union of sets *A* and *B*, where *n=max(|A|,|B|)*. The output should be an array of distinct elements that form the union of the sets, such that they appear more than once in the union.

* Assume that *A* and *B* are unsorted. Give an *O(nlogn)* algorithm for the problem.
* Assume that *A* and *B* are sorted. Give an *O(n)* algorithm for the problem.
