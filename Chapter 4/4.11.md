4-11. Design an *O(n)* algorithm that, given a list of *n* elements, finds all the elements that appear more than *n/2* times in the list. Then, design an *O(n)* algorithm that, given a list of *n* elements, finds all the elements that appear more than *n/4* times.

**Solution**

**My approach**
Use a dictionary to map entries to their occurrence counts. This runs in *O(n)*; now walk the dictionary to find entries whose occurrence count is > *n/2* (or *n/4 in the second case).

A much better approach is the linear time Majority vote algorithm [here](A Linear Time Majority Vote Algorithm). The interactive page also demonstrates it in action.

Here is the algorithm in action:

    guess = n[0]
    
    count = 1
    
    for(i = 1; i < n; i++)
    
        if (guess = n[i]) {
        
            count++
            
        } else {
        
            count--
            
            if ( count = 0 )

                guess = item[i];
                
                count = 1
        
        }
        
     //Guess should be the largest count however you can do another pass to verify it occurs more than n>2 times.
