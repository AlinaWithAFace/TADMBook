4-12. Devise an algorithm for finding the *k* smallest elements of an unsorted set of *n* integers in *O(n+klogn)*.

**Solution**

Build an unsorted list in *O(n)* that ensures that the smallest item is at the top of the heap. Next, extract the *k* smallest items in *O(klogn)* time to give the desired *O(n+klogn)* run time.
