4-14. Give an *O(nlogk)*-time algorithm that merges *k* sorted lists with a total of *n* elements
 into one sorted list. (Hint: use a heap to speed up the elementary *O(kn)*-time algorithm).

**Solution**

* For each of the *k* sorted lists, build a min-heap containining each corresponding head element and its parent list

* From this heap of *k* elements, find the smallest element in *O(logk)* time, append it to the merged list and then delete it from the heap

* Insert the next head element from the parent list containing the deleted heap element. Takes *O(logk)* time again

* Repeat for the *n* elements. This would give an *O(nlogk)* run time.

Alternative approach would be to use mergesort treating each list as a binary tree of *k* leaves.
