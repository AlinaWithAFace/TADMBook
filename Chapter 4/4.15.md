(a) Give an efficient algorithm to find the second-largest key among *n* keys. You can do better than *2nâˆ’3* comparisons. 

(b) Then, give an efficient algorithm to find the third-largest key among *n* keys. How many key comparisons does your algorithm do in the worst case? Must your algorithm determine which key is largest and second-largest in the process?

**Solution**

(a) The *2n - 3* limit can be achieved by doing a linear scan through the array while keeping track of the
biggest and next biggest values. 

(b) There are a couple of approaches here:

* You can do a linear scan and retrieve here too
* Use a heap sort and retrieve the third smallest number
* Use the tournament selection algorithm
