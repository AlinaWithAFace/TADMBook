4-14. Give an *O(nlogk)*-time algorithm that merges *k* sorted lists with a total of *n* elements
 into one sorted list. (Hint: use a heap to speed up the elementary *O(kn)*-time algorithm).

**Solution**

* For each of the *k* sorted lists, build a min-heap with its corresponding elements 
at each index to facilitate *O(logk)* retrievals

* Heapify after deletion also takes *O(logk)*

* Go through the *n* elements and for each index, retrieve the smallest elements in order from the
corresponding *k-heap*. This would give an *O(nlogk)* run time.
