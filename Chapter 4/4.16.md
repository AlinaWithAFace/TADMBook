4-16. Use the partitioning idea of quicksort to give an algorithm that finds the median element of an array of *n* integers in expected *O(n)* time. (Hint: must you look at both sides of the partition?)

**Solution** 

This is a specialized form of finding the *kth* largest number; in the median scenario, *k = n / 2*.

A suitable algorithm here is the [QuickSelect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickselect) algorithm: a randomized version of the [QuickSort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) algorithm.

The algorithm is described as thus:

**Steps**

* Set *k* to the appropriate value, e.g. for median *k* is *n/2*.

* Select a random pivot element *p*

* Partition the array around the pivot element into two arrays: *smaller* and *larger* containing all the elements that are smaller and larger than the pivot respectively

    * If *k* == length of *smaller*; then the *kth* largest number lies in the *smaller* array; recurse on this array and trying to find the *kth* largest entry
    
    * Else if *k* > (length of array - length of *larger*) then the *kth* largest number is in the *larger* array. Recurse on this array, however now set the *kth* value to be *k -(length of array - length of *larger*)* to account for the offset.
    
    * Else the *kth* value is the desired value
    
    
For the median case, this results in *O(n)* run time since we decay the interval in every section by *2*.
