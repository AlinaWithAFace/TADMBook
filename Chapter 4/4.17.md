4-17. The median of a set of *n* values is the ⌈n/2⌉th smallest value.

1. Suppose quicksort always pivoted on the median of the current sub-array. How many comparisons would Quicksort make then in the worst case?

2. Suppose quicksort were always to pivot on the ⌈n/3⌉th smallest value of the current sub-array. How many comparisons would be made then in the worst case?

**Solution** 

1. Choosing the median results in two equal halves, total run time will then be *On(logn)* because there would be *O(logn)* comparisions required *n* times.

2. This would take *O(log(3/2)n)* comparisions.
