4-18. Suppose an array *A* consists of *n* elements, each of which is *red*, *white*, or *blue*. We seek to sort the elements so that all the *reds* come before all the *whites*, which come before all the *blues*. The only operation permitted on the keys are

1. *Examine(A, i)* -- report the color of the *ith* element of *A*.
2. *Swap(A, i, j)* -- swap the *ith* element of *A* with the *jth* element.

Find a correct and efficient algorithm for *red-white-blue* sorting. There is a linear-time solution.


**Solution** 

This requires a three-way partition.

Start with three pointers, one to the beginning of the array, one to track the walker and the last to point to
the end of the array. Also calculate the midpoint value of the array.

While the walker is less than the end of the array do the following:


*Algorithm*

Find the first middle element and swap its position so that it is definitely in the middle position of the array.
For our scenario, this would ensure that the *middle* element is *white*.
    
    start = 0
    walker = 0
    end = size_of_array - 1
    mid = Array[size_of_array / 2]
    
    while(walker < end)
        if(Array[walker] < mid) //i.e. *red* should come before *white*
            Swap(A, i, walker)
            i++
            j++
        else if (Array[walker] > mid) //i.e. *blue* should come after *white*
            Swap(A, j, end)
            end--
        else 
            walker++ //already in middle position
