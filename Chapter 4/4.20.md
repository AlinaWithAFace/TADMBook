4.20 Give an efficient algorithm to rearrange an array of *n* keys so that all the negative keys 
precede all the nonnegative keys. Your algorithm must be in-place, meaning you cannot allocate 
another array to temporarily hold the items. How fast is your algorithm?

**Solution** 

You can
This can be done in *O(n)* time since you have to walk all *n* items to get a total arrangement.

A solution to this can be found using the approach of [4.18](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.18.md).

You start walking the array; every time you run into a negative number, you swap it to the front otherwise you keep walking the array.
