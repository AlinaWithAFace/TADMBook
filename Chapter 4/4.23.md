4.23 We seek to sort a sequence *S* of *n* integers with many duplications, such that the number of distinct integers in *S* is *O(logn)*.
Give an *O(nloglogn)* worst-case time algorithm to sort such sequences.

**Solution** 

This is very similar to the question in [4.22](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.22.md).
This is just a case of *k* being *logn*. Same approach.
