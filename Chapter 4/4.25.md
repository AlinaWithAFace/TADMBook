4.24 Assume that the array *A[1..n]* only has numbers from *{1,â€¦,n<sup>2</sup>}* but that at most *loglogn* of these numbers ever appear. 
Devise an algorithm that sorts *A* in substantially less than *O(nlogn)*.

**Solution** 

1. Go through the original array and create a min-heap with each node containing each entry and auxilliary storage for the occurence count of each original entry. This can be done in *O(n)* X *O(logloglogn)* time (i.e. it takes *logk* time to insert each of the *k = loglogn* possible values).
2. Retrieve each element from from the heap and insert into a new sorted array making sure to repeat it by its occurrence count.

Another approach using arrays is mentioned [here](http://www.algorithm.cs.sunysb.edu/algowiki/index.php/TADM2E_4.25);
