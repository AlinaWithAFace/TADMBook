4-27. Let *P* be a simple, but not necessarily convex, polygon and *q* an arbitrary point not necessarily in *P*. Design an efficient algorithm to find a line segment originating from *q* that intersects
the maximum number of edges of *P*. In other words, if standing at point *q*, in what direction should you aim a gun so the bullet will go through the largest number of walls. A bullet through a vertex of
 *P* gets credit for only one wall. An *O(nlogn)* algorithm is possible.
