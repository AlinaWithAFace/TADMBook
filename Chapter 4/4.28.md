4-28. In one of my research papers [Ski88], I discovered a comparison-based sorting algorithm that runs in
*O(nlog√n)*. Given the existence of an *Ω(nlogn)* lower bound for sorting, how can this be possible?

**Solution**

 This probably assumes there are some constraints on the problem to get better than *Ω(nlogn)* performance.
