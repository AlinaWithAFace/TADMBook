4-29. Mr. B. C. Dull claims to have developed a new data structure for priority queues that supports the operations Insert, Maximum, and Extract-Max---all in *O(1)* worst-case time. Prove that he is mistaken. 
(Hint: the argument does not involve a lot of gory details---just think about what this would imply about the *Ω(nlogn)* lower bound for sorting.)

**Solution**

 The lower bound on sorting is *Ω(nlogn)*; if his claim is true, then it would be possible to use his data structure to sort a sequence of *n* numbers in *O(n)* time 
 by just inserting all the numbers and then extracting the maximum values consecutively.
