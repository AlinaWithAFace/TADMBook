4-31. Suppose you are given an array *A* of **n sorted numbers that has been circularly shifted *k*
positions to the right. For example, *{35,42,5,15,27,29}* is a sorted array that has been circularly
shifted *k=2* positions, while *{27,29,35,42,5,15}* has been shifted *k=4* positions.

 * Suppose you know what *k* is. Give an *O(1)* algorithm to find the largest number in A.
 * Suppose you do not know what *k* is. Give an *O(lgn)* algorithm to find the largest number in *A*. For partial credit, you may give an *O(n)* algorithm.

**Solution**

 1. Find the item at the *k -1* index; that is the largest number.
 
 2. Answers: 
 
    * *O(n)* algorithm: walk the tree until you find a number smaller than the preceding number. The number preceding
 that number is the desired largest value.
 
    * *O(lgn)*:
        
        Algorithm:
        
        1. if (A[0] < A[n]) array is properly sorted, return A[n]
        2. low = 0, high = n
        3. mid = low + high / 2
        4. Do ->
                
                if A[mid] < A[n]
                    rotation is in the left half of the array               
                    if A[mid - 1] > A[mid] return A[mid-1]
                    else
                        high = mid - 1
                        return to 4
                else 
                    rotation is in the right half of the array
                    if A[mid] > A[mid + 1] return A[mid]
                    else
                        low = mid + 1
                        return to 4
