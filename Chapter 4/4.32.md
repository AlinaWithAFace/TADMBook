4.32  Consider the numerical 20 Questions game. In this game, Player 1 thinks of a number in the 
range 1 to *n*. Player 2 has to figure out this number by asking the fewest number of true/false
 questions. Assume that nobody cheats.

 * What is an optimal strategy if *n* is known?
 
 * What is a good strategy if *n* is not known?

**Solution**

 1. Use binary search to find number in *(Ologn)* time.
 
 2. Use fast exponentiation to find the upper limit of *n* and then use binary search to quickly identify
    the number.
