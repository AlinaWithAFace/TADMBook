4.33 Suppose that you are given a sorted sequence of distinct integers *{a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, … ,a<sub>n</sub>}*.
Give an *O(lgn)* algorithm to determine whether there exists an *i* index such as *a<sub>i</sub>=i*. 
For example, in *{−10,−3,3,5,7}*, *a<sub>3</sub>=3*. In *{2,3,4,5,6,7}*, there is no such *i*.

**Solution**

The trick to solving this is to know that the array indices and array values at corresponding indices are monotically increasing.
This is because the array is sorted.

Now, if an element at some index is already greater than the index value, then there is no need to search to the right of that array
anymore and the left-half should be searched instead (and vice versa too).

Algorithm:
        
        1. low = 0, high = n
        2. mid = low + high / 2
        3. if A[mid] == mid return true 
        4. Do ->
                
                if A[mid] > mid
                    possible index is in the left half of the array               
                    high = mid
                    return to 2
                else 
                    possible index is in the right half of the array
                    low = mid
                    return to 2
