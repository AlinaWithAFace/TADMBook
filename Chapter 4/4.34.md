4.34. Suppose that you are given a sorted sequence of distinct integers *{a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, … ,a<sub>n</sub>}*,
 drawn from *1* to *m* where *n < m*. Give an *O(lgn)* algorithm to find an integer *≤ m* that is not
 present in *a*. For full credit, find the smallest such integer.

**Solution**

This is very similar to [4.33](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.33.md). There is an integer missing in a range if and only if *A[i] > i*.
However the algorithm in this scenario is thus:

Algorithm:
        
        1. low = 0, high = n
        2. mid = low + high / 2
        3. Do ->
                
                if A[mid] > mid
                    missing number is in the left half of the array               
                    high = mid
                    return to 3
                else 
                    mising number is in the right half of the array
                    low = mid
                    return to 3
