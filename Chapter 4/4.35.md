4.35. Let *M* be an *n√óm* integer matrix in which the entries of each row are sorted in 
increasing order (from left to right) and the entries in each column are in increasing order 
(from top to bottom). Give an efficient algorithm to find the position of an integer *x* in *M*,
or to determine that *x* is not there. How many comparisons of *x* with matrix entries does your
algorithm use in worst case?

**Solution**

Binary search would have worked if the first element of an arbitrary row was guaranteed to be
greater than the last element of the preceding row. However, the table below is a perfect example for
this question.

|c1 |c2 |c3 |c4 |c5  |
|---|---|---|---|----|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5  |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7  |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9  |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 10 |

Algorithm

* Choose the value at the top right corner of the matrix. (* The bottom left is also another good starting point*)
* If *x* is less than that value, then eliminate the entire column (since it is already sorted).
* Otherwise, do a binary search of the column to either find the element or eliminate the column
* If the value is greater than the preceding row element, then eliminate that row too.
* Otherwise, do a binary search along the row to either find the element or eliminate the row.
* Repeat until element is found or search space matrix is empty.
