4.36. Consider an *n√ón* array *A* containing integer elements (positive, negative, and zero). 
Assume that the elements in each row of *A* are in strictly increasing order, and the elements 
of each column of *A* are in strictly decreasing order. (Hence there cannot be two zeroes in the 
same row or the same column.) Describe an efficient algorithm that counts the number of 
occurrences of the element *0* in *A*. Analyze its running time.

**Solution**
