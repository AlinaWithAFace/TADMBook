4.40.  If you are given a million integers to sort, what algorithm would you use to sort them? 
How much time and memory would that consume?

**Solution**

Restrictions:
* The integer set is infinite
* There are only 1 million elements to sort

Unclear
* The range of values in the integers e.g. is it 1 million feet sizes or 1 million ages

These would determine the best algorithm to use.
