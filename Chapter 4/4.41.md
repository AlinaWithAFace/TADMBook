4.41. Describe advantages and disadvantages of the most popular sorting algorithms.

**Solution**

**Quick sort**

Pros
* Very fast

Cons
* Unstable
* Worst-case scenario can be *O(n<sup>2</sup>)*

**Merge sort**

Pros
* Stable
* Can be parallelized

Cons
* Uses extra storage

**Heap sort**

Pros
* Worst-case performance scenario of *O(nlogn)* 

Cons
* Unstable
* Can be slower than quick / merge sort

**Insertion sort**

Pros
* Simple

Cons
* Not suitable for large datasets due to *O(n<sup>2</sup>)* run time
