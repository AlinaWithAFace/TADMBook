4.44. Design a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the minimum element 
in constant time. Can you do this?

**Solution**

This is not possible if you use one stack since that would mean you can do sorting in 
*O(n)* time. See [4.29](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/TADMBook/blob/master/Chapter%204/4.29.md).
