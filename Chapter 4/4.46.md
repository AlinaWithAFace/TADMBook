4.46. You are given 12 coins. One of them is heavier or lighter than the rest. Identify this coin
in just three weighings.

Note - weighings are with a balance, where you can have a greater than, equal to, or less than result. You can't do this with a digital scale.

**Solution**

1. Split the coins into 2 groups of 6 and weigh both groups. The scale should identify the lighter  or heavier group.

2. Split group into 2 groups of 3 and repeat to find the outlier again.

3. Split the outlier group of 3 into single coins and weigh two of the coins. If both weighed versions are equal
then the unweighed version is the outlier coin; otherwise the scale will identify the coin.
