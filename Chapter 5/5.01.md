5.01.  For the following graphs *G1* and *G2* (see book for figure)

* Report the order of the vertices encountered on a breadth-first search starting from vertex *A*.
  Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order (i.e., *A* before *Z*).
* Report the order of the vertices encountered on a depth-first search starting from vertex *A*.
  Break all ties by picking the vertices in alphabetical order (i.e., *A* before *Z*).

**Solution**

**G1**

* ***BFS***

    A -> B -> D -> I -> C -> E -> G -> J -> F -> H

* ***DFS***

    A -> B -> C -> E -> D -> G -> H -> F -> J -> I 

**G2**

* ***BFS***

    A -> B -> E -> C -> F -> I -> D -> G -> J -> M -> H -> K -> N -> L -> O -> P

* ***DFS***

    A -> B -> C -> D -> H -> G -> F -> E -> I -> J -> K -> L -> P -> O -> N -> M
