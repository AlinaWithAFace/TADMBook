5.03.  Prove by induction that there is a unique path between any pair of vertices in a tree.

**Solution**

A tree is an acyclic graph.

The simplest possible tree is one with 2 nodes *u* and *v*; there there is a path *p* linking *u* and *v*. By extension,
any additional node *w* would also have one path to go from *w ~> u* and so on.

Assuming an arbitrary tree with lots of nodes and two distinct paths *p1* and *p2* between *u* and *v*.
Thus this means we can form a cycle between the nodes by following the path *u ~> v ~> u*. However, this is
not possible with a tree (which do not contain cycles). Thus there can be only one unique path.
