5.05. Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex
 has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite?

**Solution**

The chromatic number of a graph *G* is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of *G* so 
that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. [[Source]](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChromaticNumber.html).

 A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets *U* and *V* such that every edge connects
  a vertex in *U* to one in *V*. [[Source]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).

  Run a single BFS or DFS traversal to find out if the graph is 2-colourable. If it is, then the chromatic number
  for the graph is 2; otherwise it is 3. Why? [Brooks' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27_theorem)
  which roughly states that the max chromatic number of a graph is equal to the maximum edge degree + 1.

  Since the graph has a maximum degree of 2; thus the 2 or 3 values determined above.
