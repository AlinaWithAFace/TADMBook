5.05. Give a linear algorithm to compute the chromatic number of graphs where each vertex has degree at most 2. Must such graphs be bipartite?

**Solution**

The chromatic number of a graph *G* is the smallest number of colors needed to color the vertices of *G* so 
that no two adjacent vertices share the same color, [source](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChromaticNumber.html).

 A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets *U* and *V* such that every edge connects
  a vertex in *U* to one in *V*. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph).
