5.07.  Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct 
the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counterexample. Repeat the problem
if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.

**Solution**
 Given the tree below:
 

           A
         /  \
        B    C
       / \   /
      D   E F


The preorder traversal is ABDECF and the inorder traversal is DBEAFC.

The algorithm for re-constructing the tree is given thus:
