5.07.  Given pre-order and in-order traversals of a binary tree, is it possible to reconstruct 
the tree? If so, sketch an algorithm to do it. If not, give a counterexample. Repeat the problem
if you are given the pre-order and post-order traversals.

**Solution**
 Yes it should be possible to reconstruct the binary tree. (Heaps are a similar concept and stored in
 flat arrays).
