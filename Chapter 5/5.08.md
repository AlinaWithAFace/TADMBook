5-8. Present correct and efficient algorithms to convert an undirected graph *G* between
 the following graph data structures. You must give the time complexity of each algorithm,
  assuming *n* vertices and *m* edges.

* Convert from an adjacency matrix to adjacency lists.
* Convert from an adjacency list to an incidence matrix. An incidence matrix *M* has 
a row for each vertex and a column for each edge, such that *M[i,j]=1* if vertex *i* is part 
of edge *j*, otherwise *M[i,j]=0*.
* Convert from an incidence matrix to adjacency lists.

**Solution**

* See [Adjacency matrix to list converter](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/Algorithms/blob/master/JavaScript/src/Graphs/Converters/adjMatrixToList.js)  in the [Algorithms](https://github.com/abdulapopoola/Algorithms) repo.
