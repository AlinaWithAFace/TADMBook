Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a tree. Each leaf is an integer and each internal node is one of the standard 
arithmetical operations *(+,−,∗,/)*. For example, the expression 2+3∗4+(3∗4)/5 is represented by the tree in Figure (see book)(a). 
(see book for figure) Give an *O(n)* algorithm for evaluating such an expression, where there are *n* nodes in the tree.
