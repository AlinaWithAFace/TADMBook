5.10. Suppose an arithmetic expression is given as a DAG (directed acyclic graph) with common subexpressions removed. Each leaf is an integer and each 
internal node is one of the standard arithmetical operations (+,−,∗,/). For example, the expression 2+3∗4+(3∗4)/5 is represented by the DAG in Figure b 
(see book). Give an *O(n+m)* algorithm for evaluating such a DAG, where there are *n* nodes and *m* edges in the DAG. 
Hint: modify an algorithm for the tree case to achieve the desired efficiency.

**Solution**

The trick here is to replace a root value once it is computed to avoid recaculating it over and over again. One way would be to replace the value of a node
with its result once it is calculated.
