5-12. The square of a directed graph *G=(V,E)* is the graph *G<sup>2</sup>=(V,E<sup>2</sup>)* such that *(u,w)∈E<sup>2</sup>* iff there exists *v∈V*
 such that *(u,v)∈E* and *(v,w)∈E*; i.e., there is a path of exactly two edges from *u* to *w* in the square of a graph Give efficient algorithms for both 
 adjacency lists and matrices.

**Solution**

To compute ***G<sup>2</sup>***

**Adjacency list**

    for each vertex in the adjacency list of node u
        for each vertex in the adjacency list of node v
            edge(u,w) exists in G2 iff edge(u,v) 
            and edge(v,w) exist in G
                if so, add vertix w to the adjacency list of edge u 

This should be possible in time *(O(VE)*.

**Adjacency matrix**

The adjacency matrix of graph *G<sup>2</sup>* is the graph obtained by squaring the adjacency matrix of graph *G*.
This is possible in time *O(V<sup>3</sup>)*.
