5-13. A vertex cover of a graph *G=(V,E)* is a subset of vertices *V* such that each edge in *E*
 is incident on at least one vertex of *V*.

1. Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-size vertex cover if *G* is a tree.
2. Let *G=(V,E)* be a tree such that the weight of each vertex is equal to the degree of that 
vertex. Give an efficient algorithm to find a minimum-weight vertex cover of *G*.
3. Let *G=(V,E)* be a tree with arbitrary weights associated with the vertices. Give an efficient
 algorithm to find a minimum-weight vertex cover of *G*.
